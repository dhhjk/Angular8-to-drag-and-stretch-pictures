# Angular8 to drag and stretch pictures

Completion date: 20191031 9:30

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8.
And I also used the angular2 draggable plug-in.

Before starting this project, first store the demo data in the local storage, for exampleï¼š
[{"id":1,"x":501,"y":296,"w":84,"h":84,"l":-7,"t":-50},{"id":2,"x":126,"y":24,"w":79,"h":79,"l":52,"t":52},{"id":3,"x":324,"y":135,"w":77,"h":77,"l":5,"t":5},{"id":4,"x":572,"y":106,"w":62,"h":62,"l":-5,"t":-5},{"id":5,"x":343,"y":20,"w":48,"h":48,"l":28,"t":36}]

This is my frist angular program.
You can ask me any question you have.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
